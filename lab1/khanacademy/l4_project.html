      I really like <em>'The Notebook'</em>; it’s a romantic classic. The story
      is about a poor boy, called Noah, who meets a rich girl, called Allie, and
      they fall in love over one summer. But of course there are problems.
      Allie’s parents don’t approve of Noah because he’s poor and they get
      separated, then a lot of time passes before they can get together again.
      She goes away to college and he writes to her every day, but she doesn’t
      get the letters. Then after quite a long time, Noah buys an old house
      which he promised to restore for Allie. He does it up and she sees a
      newspaper article about it and goes to find him again. You can probably
      guess the rest, but it’s a bit complicated because she is engaged to
      another man. Noah is played by <em>Ryan Gosling</em>, who’s my favourite
      actor, and he stops the film being too soppy – but you still cry a lot at
      the end. <em>Rachel McAdams</em> is really good too, as Allie.

      When it comes to music, I can hardly decide what is my favorite! I love
      music so much, I listen to my Soundcloud daily to destress my mind or to
      escape reality to imagine. I admit, it does take toll on my timing to do
      work. I tend to listen to tropical/deep house music and it’s so beautiful
      that I tend to give in temptation to listen!
      <br />
      My favorite song of the moment would be,<em> “EDX-Breathin‘”</em>. This
      song is a deep house song that’s really serene. It’s a very romantic song
      that emphasizes on falling in love with a significant other. It’s a
      perfect song for a wedding, summer fling, or even a romantic comedy! I
      mostly listen to the melody and how the piano elegantly plays while the
      beat is still going on. It’s one of those songs that I have playing in my
      head when I’m at school here. I’m not in a relationship, yet. Although, I
      could say that I’m in love with school and that’s what the song translates
      for me.

      I have been dreaming of our <em>California road</em> trip for years. It
      started with San Francisco and then stretched all the way down the coast
      to San Diego, even adding trips to Portland and New York on either end. So
      when Brand USA asked me to write about my dream US trip, my first thought
      was: I’m already doing it! But then I realised that there are so many
      other trips we’re dreaming of for the future too: New Orleans; the Disney
      parks in Florida (I can’t wait for Otis to be old enough for them!); so
      many of the national parks; and I’m also really keen on exploring the East
      coast, as well as spending more time in Austin. We’re going to have to
      keep coming back!
